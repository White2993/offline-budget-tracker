# offline-budget-tracker

More copy pasted code from previous projects. In my defense, the actual requirements of the assignment gave me quite a bit of difficulty. I guess that's the entire point. 

Usually I like troubleshooting, but not in this case. Took a lot longer than I would've expected or liked.
Anyway.

Process 

1. Copy Paste Code
2. Finish setting up file structure 
3. Tie routes to the actual project
4. Got project working online
5. Got project deployed to heroku
6. Got project to work offline
7. Got project to work on heroku(Hopefully)
